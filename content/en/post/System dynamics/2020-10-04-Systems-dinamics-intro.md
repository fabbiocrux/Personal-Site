# Looking for systemic solutions

 >We can thus say with some confidence that, under the assumption of no major change in the present system, population and industrial growth will certainly stop within the next century, at the latest. --- *The Limits to Growth, page 126*

Recently, I get interest in the field of system dynamics. This is a research field developed by the MIT Professor Jay Forrester. One of the points that highlights Prof. Forrester is that every model is wrong, but in some way they are useful.
The seek for solutions of what could be our world in the next century is a thrilling research path.
Nevertheless, it the most difficult one because we need to reconcile the understanding with predictability.
In this point we make an assessments of what is usefulness.

One of the first elements to ask is what is a system?
Using the definition gqve by Donella "Dana" Meadows  in the book:[^1] 
>A system is a set of things—people, cells, molecules, or whatever—interconnected in such a way that they produce their own pattern of behavior over time.

The system may be buffeted, constricted, triggered, or driven by outside forces. 
But the system’s response to these forces is characteristic of itself, and that response is seldom simple in the real world.

## Why is it interesting with System Dynamics?
