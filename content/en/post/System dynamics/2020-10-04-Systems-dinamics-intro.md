# Looking for systemic solutions

 >We can thus say with some confidence that, under the assumption of no major change in the present system, population and industrial growth will certainly stop within the next century, at the latest. --- *The Limits to Growth, page 126*

The seek for solutions of what could be our world in the next century is a thrilling research path.
Nevertheless, it the most difficult one because we need to reconcile the understanding with predictability.
In this point we make an assessments of what is usefulness.

Recently, I started to get interest in the field of system dynamics, a research field developed by the MIT Profesor Jay Forrester. One of the points that highlights Prof. Forrester is that every model is wrong, but some are useful.


So, what is a system? A system is a set of things—people, cells, molecules, or whatever—interconnected in such a way that they produce their own
pattern of behavior over time. The system may be buffeted, constricted,
triggered, or driven by outside forces. But the system’s response to these
forces is characteristic of itself, and that response is seldom simple in the
real world.
