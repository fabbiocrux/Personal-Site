This is a demonstration of Bitstream Charter as a web font.  This
font has both a regular (&ldquo;Roman&rdquo;) form, <b>a bold form</b>, a form
<i>in italics</i>, and a <b><i>bold italic form</i></b>.  Here is some 
sample text:
<p>
   There was in the days of Herod, the king of Judea, a certain priest
   named Zacharias, of the priestly division of Abijah. He had a wife of
   the daughters of Aaron, and her name was Elizabeth. They were both
   righteous before God, walking blamelessly in all the commandments and
   ordinances of the Lord. But they had no child, because Elizabeth was
   barren, and they both were well advanced in years. Now it happened,
   while he executed the priest's office before God in the order of his
   division, according to the custom of the priest&rsquo;s office, his lot was
   to enter into the temple of the Lord and burn incense. The whole
   multitude of the people were praying outside at the hour of incense.
<p><i>
   An angel of the Lord appeared to him, standing on the right side of the
   altar of incense. Zacharias was troubled when he saw him, and fear fell
   upon him. But the angel said to him, &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be afraid, Zacharias,
   because your request has been heard, and your wife, Elizabeth, will
   bear you a son, and you shall call his name John. You will have joy and
   gladness; and many will rejoice at his birth. For he will be great in
   the sight of the Lord, and he will drink no wine nor strong drink. He
   will be filled with the Holy Spirit, even from his mother&rsquo;s womb. He
   will turn many of the children of Israel to the Lord, their God. He
   will go before him in the spirit and power of Elijah, &lsquo;to turn the
   hearts of the fathers to the children,&rsquo; and the disobedient to the
   wisdom of the just; to prepare a people prepared for the Lord.&rdquo;
</i><p><b>
   Zacharias said to the angel, &ldquo;How can I be sure of this? For I am an
   old man, and my wife is well advanced in years.&rdquo;
<p>
   The angel answered him, &ldquo;I am Gabriel, who stands in the presence of
   God. I was sent to speak to you, and to bring you this good news.
   Behold, you will be silent and not able to speak, until the day that
   these things will happen, because you didn&rsquo;t believe my words, which
   will be fulfilled in their proper time.&rdquo;
